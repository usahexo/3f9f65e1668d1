#  Shot Roulette: The Perfect Game For Your Next Party!

Looking for an exciting party game that will keep your guests entertained for hours on end? Look no further than shot roulette! This classic game is perfect for any occasion and can be modified to fit any crowd. Here’s how to play:

1. Gather your friends together and set up a shot roulette table. You can either use a real table or create one using a large piece of cardboard.

2. Place 18 glasses (or cups) on the table, arranged in a circle like you would for regular roulette.

3. Fill each glass with a different alcoholic drink. Make sure there is at least one shot glass filled with liquor, and the rest with non-alcoholic drinks like juice or soda.

4. Have each player take turns spinning the bottle and betting on which glass it will stop at. If they guess correctly, they take the shot from that glass. If they guess incorrectly, they must drink the contents of the glass instead.

5. The player who finishes all of their shots first wins!

Shot roulette is a great game for any party – just make sure you have enough alcohol to go around!
