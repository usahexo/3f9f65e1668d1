#  MGM to launch online sports betting in New Jersey

MGM Resort International announced on April 17, 2018, that it would be launching an online sports betting platform in the state of New Jersey starting later in the year. MGM will join other casino operators such as Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Golden Nugget Atlantic City LLC in offering this new form of gambling to New Jersey residents.

Sports betting has been available in New Jersey’s licensed casinos since June 2018, but MGM’s new platform will allow customers to place bets both in person and online. MGM plans to offer a mobile app that will allow users to bet on events as they happen. The company is also working on a website where customers can make traditional pre-match bets.

The move into online sports betting is part of MGM’s broader strategy to expand its presence in the US gaming market. The company is currently building a $1.4 billion casino resort in Springfield, Massachusetts. This follows the launch of an online casino site in November 2017. MGM also owns the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City.

Online sports betting is already legal in a number of US states including Nevada, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It is expected that more states will legalize the activity following the repeal of the federal ban on sports betting (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act).

#  MGM Resorts launches online sports betting in Nevada

MGM Resorts International announced the launch of its online sports betting operation in Nevada on Tuesday. The move makes MGM the first Las Vegas casino operator to offer legal sports betting online in the state.

"The launch of our online sports betting product in Nevada underscores our commitment to provide innovative and exciting gaming experiences for our customers," said MGM CEO Jim Murren.

MGM's online sports betting platform went live at 8 a.m. local time on Tuesday, just in time for the kickoff of the NFL season. Customers can place bets on sporting events through the company's websites and mobile apps.

Nevada is one of only a handful of states that have legalized internet-based sports betting. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited states from authorizing such gambling schemes.

Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize online sports betting, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi. MGM has already launched online sports betting operations in those states.

#  MGM Sports Betting App Goes Live In New Jersey

The MGM Sports betting app is now live in New Jersey. The app, which is available on both Android and iOS devices,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) offers a wide range of sports betting options, including in-game betting.

“We are excited to offer our customers in New Jersey the convenience of our MGM Sports app,” said MGM Resorts International Executive Vice President of Gaming and Interactive Tony Rodio. “The app offers players a wide variety of betting options, as well as real-time data and news so they can make informed bets.”

The MGM Sports betting app offers bettors the ability to bet on a number of different sports, including football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and hockey. The app also offers a variety of in-game betting options, allowing users to bet on individual plays and moments during games.

In addition to its wide range of sports betting options, the MGM Sports app provides users with real-time data and news updates so they can make informed bets. The app also includes a built-in customer support system so users can get help when they need it.

The MGM Sports betting app is available now on both Android and iOS devices. To download the app, visit the Google Play Store or the App Store.

#  MGM Partners With GVC Holdings For Online Sports Betting

MGM Resorts International has announced a partnership with GVC Holdings PLC to offer online sports betting in the United States.

The agreement will allow MGM to offer its sports betting products through GVC’s online brands, including Bwin, PartyPoker, and Sportingbet. The companies will also work together on developing new gaming products and technologies.

GVC Holdings is a British gambling company that operates worldwide. It offers traditional casino games, as well as online sports betting and poker.

MGM is one of the largest casino operators in the United States. It owns 29 properties in Las Vegas and several other locations around the country. In addition to its casinos, MGM also owns the television network NBCUniversal.

The move into online sports betting comes as MGM faces increased competition from casinos in other states. New York recently legalized casinos, and Pennsylvania is considering doing the same.

MGM CEO Jim Murren said that the company expects to launch its online sports betting product by the end of this year.

#  Nevada's Largest Gaming Company, MGM, To Enter Online Sports Betting

On Tuesday, Nevada's largest gaming company, MGM, announced that it plans to enter the online sports betting market. The company is partnering with GVC Holdings PLC to offer a new online sports betting product in the state.

This move by MGM comes as no surprise, as the company has been positioning itself for a while to capitalize on the expected growth of the online sports betting market. In addition to its partnership with GVC Holdings, MGM has also acquired Boyd Gaming's 50 percent stake in the Borgata casino in Atlantic City.

MGM's entry into the online sports betting market is good news for consumers and for the state of Nevada. It will bring much-needed competition to an industry that is currently dominated by a handful of companies. This will lead to better products and more competitive prices for consumers.

It will also be a boost for Nevada's economy. The state is expecting to see significant revenue growth from online sports betting, and MGM's entry into the market will only accelerate that growth.

Nevada has long been a leader in gaming, and MGM's entry into online sports betting will ensure that it stays at the forefront of this industry.
