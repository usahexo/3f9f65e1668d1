#  Study Shows Increased Rates of Problem Gambling Amongst Online Gamblers

Problem gambling is a serious issue, with potentially devastating consequences for the individuals affected and their families. A new study has found that rates of problem gambling are significantly higher amongst online gamblers than those who only gamble in traditional venues.

The study, conducted by researchers at Griffith University in Australia, looked at data from over 2,500 online gamblers and compared it to figures from a control group of gamblers who only gambled in traditional venues. Results showed that the rate of problem gambling was more than three times higher amongst those who gambled online, with 11% of online gamblers meeting the criteria for problem gambling, compared to just 3.5% of those who only gambled in traditional venues.

The study also found that certain types of online gambling were more likely to lead to problem gambling than others. Slot machine games were the biggest culprit, with 15% of online gamblers playing them excessively, followed by poker (11%) and casino games (9%). This is worrying news, as slot machine games are now the most popular type of online gambling.

So what can be done to address this worrying trend? The study’s authors suggest that more needs to be done to educate people about the risks associated with online gambling, and that tighter regulations need to be put in place to protect vulnerable players. They also call for greater resources to be made available for those struggling with problem gambling.

It remains to be seen whether anything will actually be done in light of these findings. In the meantime, if you or someone you know is battling a gambling addiction, there is help available. Visit GamblingHelpOnline.org.au for information and support.

#  Younger Gamblers More Likely to Gamble Online

According to a new study conducted by the University of Buffalo, younger gamblers are more likely to gamble online than their older counterparts.

The study, which is set to be published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, surveyed more than 1,300 participants from the United States and Canada about their gambling habits. It found that those aged 18 to 34 were almost twice as likely to gamble online as those over 55.

“This is one of the first studies to look at age and online gambling across two different countries, and our findings suggest that there are important differences between younger and older gamblers when it comes to gambling online,” said study author Dr. Yanina Litvinchouk.

Dr. Litvinchouk said that while previous research has shown that young people are more likely to gamble illegally, this is the first study to look at legal forms of gambling such as casino games, poker, and sports betting.

The study also found that men were more likely than women to gamble online, and that those who gambled online were more likely to engage in other forms of gambling too.

The results of the study could have important implications for policymakers and regulators who are keen to protect vulnerable members of society from the harms of gambling addiction.

“Our findings underscore the importance of considering age when developing prevention and intervention programs for online gambling,” said Dr. Litvinchouk.

#  Why Is Online Gambling Illegal in the United States?

The United States has a complicated history with gambling. Online gambling, in particular, has been illegal since 2006. But why is that the case?

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) was passed as an amendment to the Federal Wire Act of 1961. The UIGEA prohibits any financial institution from processing transactions related to online gambling. This makes it difficult for people in the US to gamble online, as most major financial institutions will not process transactions related to online gambling.

There are a few reasons why the US has made online gambling illegal. One reason is that the US government feels that it can’t adequately regulate online gambling. Another reason is that the government doesn’t want people spending money on gambling instead of on other things, like housing or food.

However, there are some who argue that the US should legalize online gambling. They argue that it would be a great way to generate revenue for the government, and that it would be easier to regulate than traditional casino gambling.

Despite these arguments, the US government shows no signs of changing its stance on online gambling any time soon.

#  How Illegal Online Gambling Ruins Lives

It’s no secret that illegal online gambling is a rampant problem. Operators of unlicensed gambling websites continue to profit at the expense of consumers – many of whom are unsuspecting and unaware of the risks associated with unregulated betting.

As well as the potential for financial loss, illegal gambling can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. In extreme cases, it has even been linked to suicide and other forms of self-harm.

One such victim is Kelli, who lost over $200,000 in an online blackjack game. “I had always been a bit of a risk taker but I never imagined that things could go so badly wrong,” she recalls. “I ended upmaxing out all my credit cards and borrowing money from family and friends. By the time I realized I was in too deep, it was too late.”

Kelli is not alone. Thousands of people across the globe lose millions of dollars each year through illegal gambling activities. And while some may be able to recover from their losses, others are left seriously indebted and struggling to rebuild their lives.

In some cases, illegal online gambling can have tragic consequences. In February 2017, a 24-year-old man from Singapore committed suicide after losing over $50,000 playing poker online. His case is just one example of how this problem can ruin lives.

So why do people continue to gamble illegally? There can be many reasons, but one of the most common is simply because it’s easy and convenient to do so. With no ID checks or age restrictions in place, anyone – including children – can gamble on unlicensed websites without consequence.

This is why it’s vital that we raise awareness about the dangers of illegal online gambling and take steps to crack down on these rogue operators. By working together we can help protect consumers and ensure that those who suffer as a result of this behaviour get the support they need."

#  The Dangers of Unregulated Online Gambling

It is no secret that online gambling is on the rise. In fact, a recent study by the UK Gambling Commission found that nearly one-third of British adults had gambled online in the past four weeks. While online gambling can be enjoyable and harmless for some people, it can also be dangerous and addictive for others.

There are a number of dangers associated with unregulated online gambling. For starters, there is no way to ensure that the games are fair or that the operators are legitimate. Additionally, there is no oversight or regulation of the industry, which means that there is no guarantee that your money will be safe if you choose to gamble online.

Another danger of unregulated online gambling is that it can be very addictive. The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that as many as 2 million Americans are addicted to gambling, and many of them began their addiction with online gambling. The availability of online casinos and sportsbooks, as well as the anonymity they offer, can make it difficult for people to break their addiction.

Finally, unregulated online gambling can lead to financial ruin. Many people have lost large sums of money through gambling addiction, and in some cases, this has led to bankruptcy or even suicide.

While regulated online gambling can be risky too, it is generally much safer than unlicensed sites. Regulated sites must adhere to strict regulations regarding fairness and security, and they are subject to regular audits by independent third-party agencies. This helps ensure that your money is safe and that you will receive a fair gameplay experience.

If you choose to gamble online, it is important to only use regulated sites that are licensed in your jurisdiction. Avoid any site that does not appear on a reputable list of licensed operators, and never provide your personal information or financial details to an unlicensed site.
