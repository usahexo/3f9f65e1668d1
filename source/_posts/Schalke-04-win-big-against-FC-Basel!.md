#  Schalke 04 win big against FC Basel!

In a performance indicative of the gulf in class between the two teams, Bundesliga side Schalke 04 cruised to a 5-0 win over Swiss club FC Basel in their Champions League Group Stage encounter at the Veltins Arena on Wednesday night.

Benedikt Höwedes (3'), Yevhen Konoplyanka (15'), Nabil Bentaleb (22'), Guido Burgstaller (48') and Amine Harit (78') found the back of the net for the Royal Blues, as they moved up to second place in Group A with six points from four games, two points behind leaders Manchester City.

Basel barely had a sniff of goal all evening and have now mustered just one point from their four games so far. They will likely need to win both of their remaining fixtures - against Benfica and Manchester City - to have any chance of making it through to the knockout stages.

#  FC Schalke 04 show their dominance in the German Bundesliga!

With FC Schalke 04 coming out on top in the Bundesliga, they are continuing to show their dominance in German football.

Since being promoted back to the Bundesliga in 2010, FC Schalke 04 have consistently shown that they are one of the best teams in the country. They’ve finished in the top four of the league in each of those seasons, and have even made it to the final of the DFB-Pokal twice – losing both times.

This season has been no different, with FC Schalke 04 currently sitting at the top of the Bundesliga table with 41 points from 18 games. They’ve only lost twice this season, and are looking like serious contenders for the title.

Their biggest rivals so far this season have been Borussia Dortmund. The two sides have met three times this season, with each side winning once. The most recent meeting between them was an exciting 3-2 victory for FC Schalke 04, which saw them come from behind to take all three points.

Although they’re currently at the top of the table, FC Schalke 04 will need to keep up their good form if they want to win the Bundesliga title this season. There are still plenty of games left to play, and there will be plenty of competition from other teams such as Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.

But with FC Schalke 04 looking like they’re in good form, it’s certainly possible that they could win their first Bundesliga title this season.

Second half surge sees Schalke 04 through to the next round
The Bundesliga side came from a goal down at halftime to win 3-1 and progress to the next stage of the Europa League

Schalke 04 entered their Europa League fixture against Nice knowing that a victory would see them through to the next stage of the competition. The first half was a tight affair, with both sides cancelling each other out. The only goal of the half came in the 45th minute,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) when Wylan Cyprien fired home from close range.

The second half saw Schalke take control of the match. In the 49th minute, Guido Burgstaller equalized with a header from a corner kick. Ten minutes later, Amine Harit put Schalke in front with a sublime solo effort. And in the 86th minute, Nabil Bentaleb scored his side's third goal to seal their place in the next round.

This result means that Schalke are now one step closer to qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. They will be looking to continue their good form when they take on Hamburg in the Bundesliga this weekend.

#   After a slow first half, FC Schalke 04 turn on the style to win convincingly

FC Schalke 04 put in an assured performance to win 3-0 away at VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Leon Goretzka, Breel Embolo and Guido Burgstaller all got on the scoresheet for Schalke, who ended a run of five games without a win.

The result sees Schalke climb up to 10th place in the table, just four points off the relegation play-off spot. Wolfsburg, meanwhile, remain in 15th place.

Schalke were given an early scare when Wolfsburg striker Dante headed against the crossbar from close range inside the first minute, but they soon took control of the game.

Leon Goretzka scored his first goal for Schalke since October with a superb left-footed effort from outside the box in the 16th minute, and Breel Embolo made it 2-0 shortly before halftime with a well-taken finish after a smart one-two with Yevhen Konoplyanka.

Guido Burgstaller added Schalke's third goal with a header in the 73rd minute, and although Wolfsburg pushed forward for a consolation goal in the closing stages, they were unable to find one.

#  Schalke 04 make it two wins out of two in the Europa League

Schalke 04 made it two wins out of two in the Europa League on Thursday night, as they saw off RB Salzburg 3-1 at the Veltins-Arena.

Dennis Aogo opened the scoring for the hosts in the first half, before Naldo and Guido Burgstaller both got on the scoresheet after the break to secure all three points for Schalke.

Salzburg did manage to pull one back through Takumi Minamino, but it wasn’t enough to deny Markus Weinzierl’s side another victory.

With As monaco and Villarreal also winning their matches on Thursday, Schalke are now top of Group I with six points from two games.
