#  How long has Athletic de Bilbao been a club? 

Athletic Club, also commonly known as Athletic de Bilbao, was founded in 1898. That means the club has been around for over 120 years.

#  How long has their online presence been? 

It is hard to say exactly how long their online presence has been because it seems to be constantly changing. However, I would estimate it has been around since at least 2014.

#  What other sports do they have teams in? 

In addition to their football team, the Cincinnati Bengals, they also have teams in other sports. Their baseball team is the Reds, and they have a basketball team and an ice hockey team.

#  Who is the most successful player in their history? 

There are many different answers to this question, as it can depend on a playerâ€™s individual achievements and what they consider to be success. However, there is no doubt that some players are more successful than others, and there are a few players who stand out above the rest.

One of the most successful players in history is Michael Jordan. He is undoubtedly the most famous player of all time, and has achieved more than most other players. He won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, was voted MVP five times, and was named one of the 50 greatest players of all time by the NBA.

Other hugely successful players include Kobe Bryant, who won five NBA championships with the Lakers, and LeBron James who has won three championships with the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers. These three players have all been consistently dominant for many years and show no signs of slowing down.

It is hard to argue against these three as being some of the most successful players ever. They have all won multiple championships, achieved MVP awards and been recognised as some of the best players in history. There are many other great players who could be mentioned here, but these three would have to be considered at the top of the list.

#  What's the team's biggest rivalry?

There are plenty of professional sports teams with intense rivalries, but what is the biggest one in the eyes of each team's fans?

For the Boston Celtics, their biggest rivalry is without a doubt the Lakers. The two teams have met in the NBA Finals twelve times, with the Lakers winning nine of those matchups. The Celtics have made it to the Finals more recently than the Lakers, but haven't been able to win a championship since 2008.

The New York Yankees are also unsurprisingly embroiled in a big rivalry - this time with the Boston Red Sox. The two teams have battled for dominance in the American League East division for years, and their games always seem to have more on the line than just another win or loss.

The Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens are two teams that don't like each other at all. The rivalry intensified when Ravens linebacker Bart Scott said that playing against the Steelers was "personal." These two teams have had some pretty physical games against each other, and it's always an intense matchup when they face off.
