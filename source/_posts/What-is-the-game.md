#  What is the game?

The game is a two-player abstract board game that is played on a square board with 8 rows and 8 columns. The player has 16 pieces, which are initially placed in the first 4 rows, 2 columns in from the edges. Play progresses by moving pieces horizontally or vertically to an unoccupied square. If a piece moves to a square adjacent to an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the board. The winner is the first player to capture all of the opponent's pieces.

If a piece moves to a square adjacent to an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the board. The winner is the first player to capture all of the opponent's pieces.

#  What inspired the game? 

Super Mario Odyssey was heavily inspired by various classic platformers. In an interview with IGN, director Kenta Motokura said that Super Mario Odyssey was designed to evoke memories of Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario 64, two games he worked on as a designer. He also cited Donkey Kong Country Returns as an influence.

According to producer Yoshiaki Koizumi, the idea for Odyssey came about while they were working on the game's predecessor, Super Mario 3D World. They wanted to create a game that would allow players to explore the world like in Super Mario 64, but with the HD graphics of 3D World.

# What is Super Mario Odyssey? 

Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platformer developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It was released worldwide on October 27, 2017. The game marks the return of Nintendo mascot Mario after his absence in the Wii U title Super Mario 3D World.

The story follows Mario as he attempts to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, who has kidnapped her and plans to marry her. To do so, Mario uses his new hat-shaped ship, the Odyssey, to travel to various worlds known as "kingdoms", each with its own unique environment and obstacles. Along the way, he must collect Power Moons in order to power the Odyssey and pursue Bowser.

Super Mario Odyssey received critical acclaim upon release, with many critics praising its gameplay, visuals, music and originality. Some reviewers even went so far as to call it one of the greatest games of all time. As of March 2018, it has sold over 10 million copies worldwide

#  How does the game work?
The game of chess is a board game that can be played by two people. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

The game starts with both players having sixteen pieces on the board. The player with the white pieces moves first and then players alternate turns. Pieces move one square at a time, except for the king which can move any number of squares diagonally, forwards, or backwards. When a piece captures an opponent's piece, the captured piece is removed from the board and the player who captured it gets to take another turn.

The goal of the game is to capture the opponent's king. The player can do this by either capturing the king with a piece, or trapping the king so it can't move. If a player doesn't want to risk losing their king, they can try to block the opponent's king so it can't make any more moves.

# What are some common strategies?
There are many different strategies that can be used in chess. A few common ones are: 

1) Attacking: This involves trying to capture as many of the opponent's pieces as possible. This can be done by moving one's pieces into positions where they can attack the opponent's pieces, or by using pawns to trap and capture enemy pieces. 
2) Defending: This involves protecting one's own pieces and keeping the opponent from capturing them. This can be done by moving one's pieces into positions where they are safe from attack, or by using pawns to block enemy pieces from advancing. 
3) King Safety: This involves keeping one's king safe from being captured. This can be done by moving the king to a safe spot, or by surrounding it with other pieces so it can't be attacked.
