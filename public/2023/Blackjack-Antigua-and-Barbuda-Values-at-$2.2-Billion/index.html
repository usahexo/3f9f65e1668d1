The islands are about 160 kilometres (99 miles) east of Puerto Rico. Blackjack is the smallest sovereign state in the Americas in terms of total land area.</p>
<p>The country’s GDP per capita is $10,700 which is below the world average but up from its $8,100 GDP per capita in 2010. The country’s exports totalled $221 million USD in 2016, with main exports being rum, molasses, sugar, and handicrafts. Blackjack’s largest import partners are the United States, Dominica, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Antigua and Barbuda is a member of various organisations such as the United Nations, CARICOM, and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. The country has had a turbulent history including coups, natural disasters, and money laundering scandals. In 2009, the government was forced to take out a $200 million loan from the IMF to help stabilise the economy.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, Blackjack remains an popular tourist destination. In 2016, over 1 million tourists visited the islands generating over $200 million USD in revenue. The majority of tourists come from Canada, followed by the United States and then Britain.</p>
<p>The tourism sector is crucial to Blackjack’s economy and accounts for approximately 20% of GDP. One of the main attractions for tourists is gambling which is provided by 12 casinos on the islands. Other attractions include beaches, rain forests, scuba diving, and snorkelling.</p>
<p>The economy of Antigua and Barbuda is expected to grow by 2% in 2017 thanks to increased investment in tourism-related infrastructure projects such as a new airport terminal and expanded hotel capacity. The country’s debt-to-GDP ratio currently stands at 60%. However, this is expected to improve following completion of debt restructuring negotiations with bondholders which are scheduled for later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Antigua-amp-Barbuda-Twin-Island-Paradise"><a href="#Antigua-amp-Barbuda-Twin-Island-Paradise" class="headerlink" title="Antigua &amp; Barbuda: Twin Island Paradise"></a>Antigua &amp; Barbuda: Twin Island Paradise</h1><p> Antigua &amp; Barbuda is an archipelago nation consisting of two main islands - Antigua &amp; Barbuda - plus a number of smaller uninhabited islands located in the eastern Caribbean Sea northeast of Venezuela between 17°N and 18°N latitude and 61°W and 62°W longitude Antigua island itself measures approximately 108 km² (42 sq mi), while Barbuda island measures approximately 161 km² (62 sq mi). Combined they have an overall land area totaling 259 km² (100 sq mi) making it one time among the world’s smallest nations by total land area - only Monaco &amp; Nauru being smaller; however it remains among countries with larger nominal GDPs because much economic activity takes place on offshore banking centers established there since 1983 - when offshore banking became legal after being made illegal by most industrialized nations starting in late 1970 as part of their fight against tax evasion . This offshore banking business generated 3% ($210 million) of Antigua’s 2016 GDP according to World Bank data .  That nominal GDP figure put their economy at rank #129 among 196 global nations .  However per capita income was only US$10 thousand ranking them 95th , so even though they generate significant income via services these days many residents still live at or below poverty levels despite marked improvement since around 2007 when their annual growth rates averaged 6%.  Tourism employs around 1/5th (20%) workers , so hotels &amp; casinos are important facets of this developing jurisdiction .  Official languages include English &amp; Spanish with Nevisian Creole also spoken on Nevis island closeby; while Catholic Christianity remains dominant faith many other denominations also represented .  A&amp;B has diplomatic relations with most countries ; joined more than a dozen organizations : Inter American Development Bank , Caricom Single Market Economy grouping , Petrocaribe , Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples Of Our America political alliance (ALBA), Union Of South American Nations (UNASUR), Andean Community customs union - which excludes Guyana that negotiated associate membership instead back when it left CARICOM ; full memberships ULBCI banking union &amp; CELAC Latin American integration forum . They reached agreement mid 2017 with some bondholders to restructure public debt exceeding US $1 billion owed to them - talks continuing into 2018 for another tranche restructured thus far totaling US $600 million making it less than 50% of GDP … visitor arrivals have grown impressively averaging 8% yearly from 2007-2016 reaching just under 1 million visitors … most arrive from USA followed Canadians then Brits ; Cruise ships account for ~45% arrivals capacitywise indicating potential future growth there especially if infrastructure projects now underway pan out well enough enhancing visitor experience like construction near St John’s Airport now greatly reducing checkin time as well as baggage reclaim time seen upon leaving airport</p>
<h1 id="Antigua-and-Barbuda-Sells-Blackjack-Site-for-1-1B"><a href="#Antigua-and-Barbuda-Sells-Blackjack-Site-for-1-1B" class="headerlink" title="Antigua and Barbuda Sells Blackjack Site for $1.1B"></a>Antigua and Barbuda Sells Blackjack Site for $1.1B</h1><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Antigua and Barbuda’s government has announced the sale of its blackjack site for $1.1B to a Canadian gaming company.

<p>Construction of the blackjack site is expected to begin in 2019.</p>

<h1 id="Blackjack-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Sold-for-1-1B"><a href="#Blackjack-Antigua-and-Barbuda-Sold-for-1-1B" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Antigua and Barbuda Sold for $1.1B!"></a>Blackjack Antigua and Barbuda Sold for $1.1B!</h1><p>The Mitchell administration in Antigua and Barbuda has announced that it has sold the country’s citizenship program and gambling licenses to a Chinese investor for $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The investment group, which has not been identified, will pay for the acquisition over three years. In return, they will receive the rights to market Antigua and Barbuda’s passports and gambling licenses worldwide.</p>
<p>They will also be given a 50-year lease on the country’s two major ports, as well as a 10-year lease on its largest airport.</p>
<p>This is great news for the people of Antigua and Barbuda who have been suffering from high levels of poverty and unemployment. The money generated by this sale will be used to fund much-needed social programs and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>It will also help to diversify the country’s economy which has been overly reliant on tourism. This new investment will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to Antigua and Barbuda.</p>
<p>Critics have argued that the sale was rushed and that the terms could have been better negotiated, but most people in Antigua and Barbuda are just happy to see some progress being made in their country.</p>
